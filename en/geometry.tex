\section{Ellipses in Euclidean geometry}\label{s.geometry}

The proofs of theorems about planetary freely used analytic geometry and trigonometry, but for many years after the invention of analytic geometry, mathematicians continued to limit themselves to Euclidean geometry. Even into the late nineteenth century, students continued to study the original works of Euclid and Newton. In this section, I present proofs in Euclidean geometry (\emph{geometric proofs}) of theorems that appeared in the previous sections. The proofs are based on the definition of ellipses in terms of the geometric concepts of focus and directrix instead of the familiar analytic definition, points which satisfy the equation
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\,.
\]

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The definition of an ellipse using the focus and the directrix}

\begin{definition}
Let $d$ be a line (the \emph{directrix}) and $S$ be a point (the \emph{focus}) not on the directrix. Let $0<e<1$ be a number (the \emph{eccentricity}). An \emph{ellipse} is the geometric locus of points $P$ such that the ratio of  $PS$ to the distance of $P$ to the directrix is $e$.
\end{definition}

All the conic sections (parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas) are defined the same way and are distinguished by their eccentricity. You might be familiar with the definition of the parabola where $e=1$ (Figure~\ref{f.parabola}).

\begin{figure}[b]

\draw (F) -- (P4) -- (5,-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{A parabola defined by the focus and the directrix}\label{f.parabola}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be the intersection of the perpendicular to the directrix from $S$. $A$ on $SX$ is a \emph{vertex} of the ellipse if $SA/AX=e$ (in Figure~\ref{f.def-ellipse}, $e=1/2$).
\end{definition}

\subsubsection*{Constructing the vertices}

Given $e=SA/AX$ we can locate $A$ as follows:
\begin{eqn}
SA+AX&=&SX\\[4pt]
SA&=&SX\cdot \frac{e}{1+e}\\[4pt]
AX&=&SX\cdot \frac{1}{1+e}\,.
\end{eqn}
Similarly, there is a second vertex $A'$ where
\begin{eqn}
A'X-SA'&=&SX\\[4pt]
SA'&=&SX\cdot \frac{1}{1-e}\\[4pt]
A'X&=&SX\cdot \frac{2-e}{1-e}\,.
\end{eqn}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Constructing points on an ellipse}

Select an \emph{arbitrary} point $E$ on the directrix and construct lines from $E$ through $A$ and $S$. The line through $S$ will make an angle $\alpha$ with $SX$. Construct a line from $S$ at the \emph{same angle} $\alpha$ from $ES$ and let its intersection with $EA$ be $P$. Construct the perpendicular from $P$ to the directrix and let $K$ be its intersection with the directrix. Let $L$ be the intersection of $KP$ with $ES$ (Figure~\ref{f.construct}).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.point-on-an-ellipse}
The point $P$ is on the ellipse.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\angle PLS = \angle LSN=\alpha$ by alternate interior angles, so $\triangle LPS$ is isoceles and $PL=SP$. Since $PK\parallel SX$, $\triangle XEA\sim \triangle KEP$ and $\triangle AES\sim \triangle PEL$ are adjacent pairs of similar triangles, so
\[
\frac{PS}{PK}=\frac{PL}{PK}=\frac{SA}{AX}=e\,.
\]
Therefore, $P$ is on the ellipse.\hqed

\begin{theorem}
$P'$ is on the ellipse.
\end{theorem}

\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
\begin{proof}
Since $KS$ bisects $\angle PSF$, by the exterior angle bisector theorem 
\begin{eqn}
\frac{SP'}{SP}&=&\frac{P'K}{PK}\\[4pt]
\frac{SP'}{P'K}&=&\frac{SP}{PK}=e\,,

Let us continue with the construction of Figure~\ref{f.construct} as shown in Figure~\ref{f.focal-chord}. Construct the second vertex $A'$. Construct $EA'$ and label its intersection with $SP$ by $P'$. Construct a perpendicular from $P'$ to the directrix and label its intersection with the directrix by $K'$. Label the intersection of $P'K'$ and $EL$ by $L'$.
\begin{theorem}
The point $P'$ is on the ellipse and since $PP'$ intersects $S$ it is a focal chord.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\triangle SEA' \sim \triangle L'EP'$ and $\triangle XES\sim K'EL'$ are adjacent similar triangles, so
\[
\frac{P'L'}{P'K'}=\frac{SA'}{A'X}\;.
\]
By alternate interior angles and vertical angles we have $\angle SL'P'=\angle L'SP'$ so triangle $\triangle SL'P'$ is isosceles and $P'L'=SP'$. Therefore,
\[
\frac{SP'}{P'K'}=\frac{SA'}{A'X}=e\,,
\]
and $P'$ is a point on the ellipse.\hqed

\subsection{A right angle at the focus of an ellipse}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.bisect}
Let $P,P'$ be points on the ellipse and let $F$ be the intersection of $PP'$ with the directrix. Then $FS$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle P'SP$(Figure~\ref{f.bisect-angle}).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since $P,P'$ are on the ellipse 
\[
\frac{SP}{PK}=\frac{SP'}{P'K'}=e\,,
\]
and since $\triangle PFK\sim P'FK'$,
\[
\frac{SP}{SP'}=\frac{PK}{P'K'}=\frac{PF}{P'F}\,.
\]
By the exterior angle bisector theorem $FS$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle P'SP$.\hqed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.right-angle}
Let $P$ be a point on the ellipse and construct lines $PA,PA'$. Label their intersections with the directrix by $E$ and $F$, respectively. Then $\angle FSE$ is a right angle (Figure~\ref{f.bisect-angle}).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$P,A,A'$ are all points on the ellipse so Theorem~\ref{thm.bisect} applies. $FS$ bisects $\angle PSA=2\gamma$ and $ES$ bisects $\angle P'SA=2\delta$, so $2\gamma + 2\delta= 180^\circ$ and $\angle FSE=\gamma + \delta= 90^\circ$.\hqed
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Ratios}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.ratios-besant}
Let $P$ be a point on an ellipse not on the major axis and construct perpendiculars $PN,PM$ from $P$ to the major and minor axes, respectively (Figure~\ref{f.besant-ratios}). Then
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{PN^2}{A'N\cdot AN}&=&\frac{BC^2}{AC^2} = \frac{b^2}{a^2}\label{eqn.pnan}\\[6pt]
\frac{PM^2}{B'N\cdot BN}&=&\frac{AC^2}{BC^2} = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\label{eqn.pmbn}\,.
\end{eqnlabels}
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof} (Equation \ref{eqn.pnan})
$\triangle AXE\sim \triangle ANP$ since they are right triangles and the vertical angles at $A$ are equal (red). Therefore,
\begin{equation}
\frac{PN}{AN}=\frac{EX}{AX}\,.\label{eqn.triangle1}
\end{equation}
$\triangle PA'N\sim \triangle FA'X$ (blue) so
\begin{equation}
\frac{PN}{A'N}=\frac{FX}{A'X}\,.\label{eqn.triangle2}
\end{equation}
Multiplying Equations~\ref{eqn.triangle1} and \ref{eqn.triangle2} gives
\[
\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot A'N}=\frac{EX\cdot FX}{AX\cdot A'X}\,.
\]
By Theorem~\ref{thm.right-angle} $\triangle FSE$ is a right triangle so by Theorem~\ref{thm.alt-hypo} giving
\[
\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot A'N}=\frac{SX^2}{AX\cdot A'X}\,.
\]
Since $P$ was arbitrary this holds for any point on the ellipse, in particular, for $B$ on the minor axis, where $PN=BC$ and $AN=AN'=AC$. Therefore,
\begin{eqn}
\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}&=&\frac{SX^2}{AX\cdot A'X}\\[6pt]
\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot A'N}&=&\frac{SX^2}{AX\cdot A'X}=\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}=\frac{b^2}{a^2}\,.\fqed
\end{eqn}
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof} (Equation \ref{eqn.pmbn})
From Equation~\ref{eqn.pnan}, since $CM=PN, PM=CN$ and by Theorem~\ref{thm.dividing},
\begin{eqnlabels}
AN\cdot NA'&=&AC^2-CN^2\\[6pt]
\frac{CM^2}{AC^2-PM^2}&=&\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\nonumber\\[6pt]
\frac{AC^2}{AC^2-PM^2}&=&\frac{BC^2}{CM^2}\label{eqn.acbc1}\\[6pt]
\frac{AC^2}{PM^2}&=&\frac{BC^2}{BC^2-CM^2}\label{eqn.acbc2}\\[6pt]
\frac{PM^2}{BM\cdot MB'}&=&\frac{AC^2}{BC^2}\nonumber\,.
\end{eqnlabels}
The equivalence of Equations~\ref{eqn.acbc1}, \ref{eqn.acbc2} can be seen by cross-multiplying the equations.\hqed

\subsection{A circle circumscribing an ellipse}

Consider a circle of radius $a$ with the same center as an ellipse (Figure~\ref{f.ellipse-circle-besant}). Choose a point $N$ on the major axis and construct a perpendicular through $N$. Let its intersections with the ellipse and the circle be $P$ and $Q$, respectively.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm.ellipse-b-over-a-besant}
The perpendicular to the major axis through a point $Q$ on the circle circumscribing an ellipse intersects the ellipse at $P$ such that
\[
\frac{PN}{QN}=\frac{BC}{AC}=\frac{b}{a}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} 
From Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios-besant},
\[
\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot NA'} = \frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\,,
\]
and by Theorem~\ref{thm.alt-hypo}, $AN\cdot NA=QN^2$.\hqed

\begin{definition}\label{def.ellipse-lr-besant}
Let $L=L_1L_2$ be a perpendicular to the major axis of an ellipse through a \emph{focus} $S$, such that its intersections with the ellipse are $L_1,L_2$. $L$ is a \emph{latus rectum} of an ellipse (Figure~\ref{f.ellipse-latus-rectum-besant}).\footnote{Normally, points are denoted by upper-case letters and line segments or lengths by lower-case letters, but $L$ for the latus rectum is the standard notation.}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.ellipse-lr-besant}
$L$, the length of the latus rectum of an ellipse, is 
$\displaystyle\frac{2b^2}{a}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios-besant},
\[
\frac{SL_1^2}{AS\cdot SA'}=\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\,.
\]
By Theorem 7.2, $SB=AC=a$, so by Pythagoras's theorem,
\[
BC^2=BS^2-SC^2=AC^2-SC^2=(AC-SC)(AC+SC)=AS\cdot SA'\,.
\]
Therefore,
\begin{eqn}
SL_1^2&=&\frac{BC^4}{AC^2}\\[4pt]
SL_1&=&\frac{BC^2}{AC}=\frac{b^2}{a}\,,
\end{eqn}
but $L_1$ is one-half the latus rectum.\hqed

\subsection{Areas of parallelograms}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.perp-tangent}
Let $Y$ be the intersection of the perpendicular to the focus $S$ and the tangent $TT'$ at $P$, and let $L$ be the intersection of $S'P$ and $SY$ (Figure~\ref{f.perp-focus-tangent}). Then $Y$ is on the circumscribing circle and $CY\parallel S'L$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$\triangle STY$ and $\triangle T'TC$ are right triangles that share the acute angle $\angle CTT'=\angle YTS$ so $\angle CT'T=\angle YST$. $\angle SPY=\angle S'PT'$ by Theorem~\ref{thm.tangent-angles} since they are the angles to the foci at the tangent and $\angle S'PT'=\angle YPL$ are vertical angles so $\angle SPY=\angle SPT$. Then $\triangle SPY\cong\triangle SPT$ since they are right triangles with an equal acute angle and a common side $PY$. Therefore, $PL=PS$ and $S'L=S'P+PL=AA'=2a$.

Since $\triangle SPY\cong\triangle$, $SY=YL$, and since $S,S'$ are foci, $S'C=SC$. It follows that $\triangle CSY\sim \triangle S'SL$ and $CY\parallel S'L$. By similarity,
\[
\frac{CY}{S'L}=\frac{CS}{S'S}=\frac{CS}{2CS}\,.
\]
Therefore, $2CY=S'L=2a$ so $CY=a$ and $Y$ is on the circumscribing circle of radius $a$.\hqed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
Continuing with the construction from Figure~\ref{f.perp-focus-tangent}, we focus on the segments $AN,NA'$ (Figure~\ref{f.segments-major}). We can deduce the angles that are shown.
\begin{itemize}
\item $CY\parallel S'P$ (Theorem~\ref{thm.perp-tangent}) so $\angle CYP = \angle S'PT'$ by corresponding angles.
\item $\angle S'PT' = \angle SPY$ by Theorem~\ref{thm.tangent-angles} since they are the angles to the foci at the tangent.
\item $\angle SYP$ and $\angle SNP$ are right angles and therefore $SYPN$ is quadrilateral that can be circumscribed by a circle whose diameter is $PS$.
Therefore, $\angle SPY = \angle SNY$ since they are subtended by the same chord $YS$.
\end{itemize}
It follows that $\triangle CYT\sim \triangle CNY$ and
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{CN}{CY}&=&\frac{CY}{CT}\nonumber\\[6pt]
CN\cdot CT&=&CY^2=AC^2\,,\label{eqn.cnctacac}
\end{eqnlabels}
since the perpendicular to the tangent from a focus is on the circumscribing circle (Theorem~\ref{thm.perp-tangent}).

Since $NT=CT-CN$, we have $CN\cdot NT = CN\cdot CT - CN^2$ which equals $AC^2-CN^2$ by Equation~\ref{eqn.cnctacac}. This in turn equals $AN\cdot NA'$ by Theorem~\ref{thm.dividing}.\hqed

Let the intersection of the tangent with the minor axis be $T$ and its intersection with the major axis be $T'$.
\[
PF\cdot PG = BC^2\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
$\triangle NPG \sim \triangle FPJ$ (rotate $\triangle NPG$ to see this) so $\angle PGN=\angle PJF = \alpha$ and
\begin{eqn}
\frac{PF}{PN}&=&\frac{PJ}{PG}\nonumber\\[6pt]
PF\cdot PG &=& PJ\cdot PN\,.\label{eqn.pnpj}
\end{eqn}
By vertical angles $\angle PGN = \angle CGF = \alpha$ so 
$\triangle NPG\sim \triangle FCG$ and $\angle NPG = \angle FCG = \beta =90^\circ-\alpha$. By adding $\beta$ to the right angle $\angle BCN =\angle BNC$, we get that $\angle BCF = \angle BCJ$ and therefore $TPJC$ is a parallelogram, so $CT=PJ$ and $PF\cdot PG = CT\cdot PN$. We need to show that $CT\cdot PN=BC^2$.

$\triangle TT'C\sim \triangle PT'N$ so 
\begin{eqn}
\frac{CT}{CT'}&=&\frac{PN}{NT'}\\[6pt]
\frac{CT}{PN}&=&\frac{CT'}{NT'}\,.
\end{eqn}
Multiplying each side by fractions equal to $1$ gives
\[
\frac{CT\cdot PN}{PN^2}=\frac{CT'\cdot CN}{CN \cdot NT'}\,,
\]
and because ...
\[
\frac{CT\cdot PN}{PN^2}=\frac{AC^2}{AN\cdot NA'}\,.
\]
By Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios-besant} 
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{CT\cdot PN}{PN^2}&=&\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot NA'}\cdot \frac{AC^2}{PN^2}=\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\cdot \frac{AC^2}{PN^2}\nonumber\\[6pt]
CT\cdot PN&=&BC^2\,.\label{eqn.ctpn}\fqed

\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm.cnntacac},
\begin{eqn}
CN\cdot CT &=& AC^2=CM\cdot CT'\\[6pt]
\frac{CM}{CN} &=& \frac{CT}{CT'}\,.
\end{eqn}
Since $DK$ and $PP'$ are conjugate diameters, $DT'\parallel PP'$ and $\triangle T'DC \sim \triangle CPT$, so
\begin{eqn}
\frac{CM}{CN} &=& \frac{CT}{CT'} =  \frac{CN}{MT'}\\[6pt]
CN^2 &=& CM\cdot MT'\,,
\end{eqn}
Therefore,
\begin{equation}
CN^2=CM\cdot MT'=AC^2-CM^2 = AM\cdot MA'\label{eqn.cnannap}
\end{equation}
by Theorem~\ref{thm.cnntacac}. By Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios-besant},
\[
\frac{DM^2}{AM\cdot MA'}=\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\,,
\]
and by Equation~\ref{eqn.cnannap},
\begin{eqn}
\frac{DM^2}{CN^2}&=&\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\\[6pt]
\frac{DM}{CN}&=&\frac{BC}{AC}\,,
\end{eqn}
A symmetric argument shows that
\begin{eqn}
CM^2&=& AN\cdot NA'\\[6pt]
\frac{CM}{PN}&=&\frac{BC}{AC}\,\fqed.
\end{eqn}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.area-parallelogram}
The area of the parallelogram formed by the tangents at the ends of the conjugate diameters $PG,DK$ is equal to the rectangle enclosing the ellipse at the ends of the axes (Figure~\ref{f.parallelogram2}).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the definition of conjugate diameters, it is sufficient to show that the area of $PCDL$ is $AC\cdot BC$. The area of a parallelogram is width times height so it is $CD\cdot PF$. 

By vertical angles $\angle DCM = \angle GCF$ and $\angle CGF = \angle PGN$, so $\triangle DCM\sim \triangle PGN$ 
\[
\frac{PG}{CD}=\frac{PN}{CM}\,,
\]
and by Theorem~\ref{thm.cmpnacbc}
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{PG}{CD}&=&\frac{BC}{AC}\nonumber\\[6pt]
\frac{CD}{AC}&=&\frac{PG}{BC}\,.\label{eqn.cdac}
\end{eqnlabels}
By Theorem~\ref{thm.parallelogram1},
\begin{equation}
\frac{PG}{BC}=\frac{BC}{PF}\,.\label{eqn.pgbc}
\end{equation}
From Equations~\ref{eqn.cdac} and~\ref{eqn.pgbc} gives $CD\cdot PF = AC \cdot BC$.\hqed
