\section{Ellipses in Euclidean geometry}\label{s.geometry}

The proofs of theorems about planetary freely used analytic geometry and trigonometry, but for many years after the invention of analytic geometry, mathematicians continued to limit themselves to Euclidean geometry. In this section, I present proofs in Euclidean geometry of theorems that appeared in Section~\ref{s.ellipse}.\footnote{Theorems~\ref{thm.tangent-angles}, \ref{thm.conj-diag} were already proved using Euclidean geometry and Theorem~\ref{thm.ellipse-area} requires taking limits.} The proofs are based on the definition of ellipses in terms of the geometric concepts of focus and directrix instead of the familiar analytic definition (Equation~\ref{eqn.ellipse-formula}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{The definition of an ellipse using the focus and the directrix}

\begin{definition}\label{def.ellipse}
Let $d$ be a line (the \emph{directrix}) and $S$ be a point (the \emph{focus}) not on the directrix. Let $0<e<1$ be a number (the \emph{eccentricity}). An \emph{ellipse} is the locus of points $P$ such that the ratio of  $PS$ to the distance of $P$ to the directrix is $e$.
\end{definition}

All the conic sections (parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas) are defined the same way and are distinguished by their eccentricity.
\begin{definition}
Let $X$ be the intersection of the perpendicular to the directrix from $S$. $A$ on $SX$ is a \emph{vertex} of the ellipse if $SA/AX=e$ (in Figure~\ref{f.def-ellipse}, $e=1/2$).
\end{definition}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Given $e=SA/AX$ we can locate $A$ as follows:
\begin{eqn}
SA+AX&=&SX\\[4pt]
SA&=&SX-\frac{SA}{e}=SX\cdot \frac{e}{1+e}\\[4pt]
AX&=&SX\cdot \frac{1}{1+e}\,.
\end{eqn}

\pagebreak[3]

Similarly, there is a second vertex $A'$ where
\begin{eqn}
A'X-SA'&=&SX\\[4pt]
SA'&=&SX+\frac{SA'}{e}=SX\cdot \frac{e}{1-e}\\[4pt]
A'X&=&SX\cdot \frac{1}{1-e}\,.
\end{eqn}%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Definition~\ref{def.ellipse} is non-constructive. It states that the ellipse is the locus of points satisfying a certain property, but aside from the vertices we have not constructed any such points. Here we show how to construct any of the points on the ellipse.

Select an \emph{arbitrary} point $E$ on the directrix and construct lines from $E$ through $A$ and $S$. The line through $S$ will make an angle $\alpha$ with $SX$. Construct a line from $S$ at the \emph{same angle} $\alpha$ from $ES$ and let its intersection with $EA$ be $P$. Construct the perpendicular from $P$ to the directrix and let $K$ be its intersection with the directrix. Let $L$ be the intersection of $KP$ with $ES$ (Figure~\ref{f.construct}).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.point-on-an-ellipse}
The point $P$ is on the ellipse.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\angle PLS = \angle LSN=\alpha$ by alternate interior angles, so $\triangle LPS$ is isosceles and $PL=SP$. Since $PK\parallel SX$, $\triangle XEA\sim \triangle KEP$ and $\triangle AES\sim \triangle PEL$ are adjacent pairs of similar triangles, so
\[
\frac{PS}{PK}=\frac{PL}{PK}=\frac{SA}{AX}=e\,.
\]
Therefore, $P$ is on the ellipse.\hqed
\end{proof}

By choosing different points $E$ on the directrix, any point on the ellipse can be constructed.

\subsection{A right angle at the focus of an ellipse}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.bisect}
Let $P,P'$ be points on the ellipse and let $F$ be the intersection of $PP'$ with the directrix. Then $FS$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle P'SP$(Figure~\ref{f.bisect-angle}).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since $P,P'$ are on the ellipse 
\[
\frac{SP}{PK}=\frac{SP'}{P'K'}=e\,,
\]
and since $\triangle PFK\sim P'FK'$,
\[
\frac{SP}{SP'}=\frac{PK}{P'K'}=\frac{PF}{P'F}\,.
\]
By the exterior angle bisector theorem (Theorem~\ref{thm.exterior-angle-bisector}), $FS$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle P'SP$.\hqed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.right-angle}
Let $P$ be a point on the ellipse and construct lines $PA,PA'$. Label their intersections with the directrix by $E$ and $F$, respectively. Then $\angle FSE$ is a right angle (Figure~\ref{f.right-angle}).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$P,A,A'$ are all points on the ellipse so Theorem~\ref{thm.bisect} applies. $FS$ bisects $\angle PSX=2\gamma$ and $ES$ bisects $\angle P'SX=2\delta$, so $2\gamma + 2\delta= 180^\circ$ and $\angle FSE=\gamma + \delta= 90^\circ$.\hqed
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Ratios of perpendiculars to the axes}

This theorem proves Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios} using Euclidean geometry.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.ratios-besant}
Let $P$ be a point on an ellipse not on the major axis and construct perpendiculars $PN,PM$ from $P$ to the major and minor axes, respectively (Figure~\ref{f.besant-ratios}). Then
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{PN^2}{A'N\cdot NA}&=&\frac{BC^2}{AC^2} = \frac{b^2}{a^2}\label{eqn.pnan}\\[6pt]
\frac{PM^2}{B'N\cdot NA}&=&\frac{AC^2}{BC^2} = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\label{eqn.pmbn}\,.
\end{eqnlabels}
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof} (Equation \ref{eqn.pnan})
$\triangle AXE\sim \triangle ANP$ since they are right triangles and the vertical angles at $A$ are equal (red). Therefore,
\begin{equation}
\frac{PN}{AN}=\frac{EX}{AX}\,.\label{eqn.triangle1}
\end{equation}%
$\triangle PA'N\sim \triangle FA'X$ (blue) so
\begin{equation}
\frac{PN}{A'N}=\frac{FX}{A'X}\,.\label{eqn.triangle2}
\end{equation}%
Multiplying Equations~\ref{eqn.triangle1} and \ref{eqn.triangle2} gives
\[
\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot A'N}=\frac{EX\cdot FX}{AX\cdot A'X}\,.
\]
By Theorem~\ref{thm.right-angle} $\triangle FSE$ is a right triangle so by Theorem~\ref{thm.alt-hypo},
\[
\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot A'N}=\frac{SX^2}{AX\cdot A'X}\,.
\]
Since $P$ was arbitrary this holds for any point on the ellipse, in particular, for $B$ on the minor axis, where $PN=BC$ and $AN=AN'=AC$. Therefore,
\begin{eqn}
\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}&=&\frac{SX^2}{AX\cdot A'X}\\[6pt]
\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot A'N}&=&\frac{SX^2}{AX\cdot A'X}=\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}=\frac{b^2}{a^2}\,.\fqed
\end{eqn}%
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof} (Equation \ref{eqn.pmbn})
Since $CM=PN, PM=CN$, by Theorem~\ref{thm.dividing}, Equation~\ref{eqn.pnan} becomes 
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{CM^2}{AC^2-PM^2}&=&\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\nonumber\\[6pt]
\frac{AC^2}{AC^2-PM^2}&=&\frac{BC^2}{CM^2}\label{eqn.acbc1}\,.
\end{eqnlabels}%
It follows that
\begin{equation}
\frac{AC^2}{PM^2}=\frac{BC^2}{BC^2-CM^2},\label{eqn.acbc2}
\end{equation}

By cross-multiplying the Equations~\ref{eqn.acbc1} and \ref{eqn.acbc2}. By Theorem~\ref{thm.dividing}, Equation~\ref{eqn.acbc2} implies
\[
\frac{PM^2}{BM\cdot MB'}=\frac{AC^2}{BC^2}\,.\fqed
\]
\end{proof}

\subsection{A circle circumscribing an ellipse}

This theorem proves Theorem~\ref{thm.ellipse-b-over-a} in Euclidean geometry.

Consider a circle of radius $a$ with the same center as an ellipse (Figure~\ref{f.ellipse-circle-besant}). Choose a point $N$ on the major axis and construct a perpendicular through $N$. Let its intersections with the ellipse and the circle be $P$ and $Q$, respectively.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm.ellipse-b-over-a-besant}
\[

\subsection{The latus rectum of an ellipse}

This theorem proves Theorem~\ref{thm.ellipse-lr} in Euclidean geometry.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.ellipse-lr-besant}
$L$, the length of the latus rectum of an ellipse (Definition~\ref{def.ellipse-lr}), is 
$\displaystyle\frac{2b^2}{a}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios-besant},
\[
\frac{SL_1^2}{AS\cdot SA'}=\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\,.
\]
By Theorem 7.2, $SB=AC=a$, so by Pythagoras's theorem,
\[
BC^2=BS^2-SC^2=AC^2-SC^2=(AC-SC)(AC+SC)=AS\cdot SA'\,.
\]
Therefore, the length of one-half the latus rectum is
\begin{eqn}
SL_1^2&=&\frac{BC^4}{AC^2}\\[6pt]
SL_1&=&\frac{BC^2}{AC}=\frac{b^2}{a}\,.\fqed
\end{eqn}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Areas of parallelograms}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.perp-tangent}
Let $Y$ be the intersection the perpendicular through the focus $S$ to the tangent $TT'$ at $P$, and let $L$ be the intersection of $S'P$ and $SY$ (Figure~\ref{f.perp-focus-tangent}). Then $Y$ is on the circumscribing circle and $CY\parallel S'L$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

$\triangle STY\sim\triangle T'TC$ since they are right triangles that share the acute angle $\angle CTT'=\angle YTS$, so $\angle CT'T=\angle YST=\beta$.

By Theorem~\ref{thm.tangent-angles}, $\angle SPY=\angle S'PT'=\alpha$ since they are the angles to the foci at the tangent. $\angle S'PT'=\angle YPL=\alpha$ are vertical angles, so $\angle SPY=\angle LPY=\alpha$. 

Then $\triangle SPY\cong\triangle LPY$ since they are right triangles with an equal acute angle and a common side $PY$. Therefore, $PL=PS$ and $S'L=S'P+PL=AA'=2a$.

Since $\triangle SPY\cong\triangle LPY$, $SY=YL$, and since $S,S'$ are foci, $S'C=SC$. It follows that $\triangle CSY\sim \triangle S'SL$ and $CY\parallel S'L$. By similarity,
\[
\frac{CY}{S'L}=\frac{CS}{S'S}=\frac{CS}{2CS}\,.
\]
Therefore, $2CY=S'L=2a$ so $CY=a$ and $Y$ is on the circumscribing circle of radius $a$.\hqed

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
Continuing with the construction from Figure~\ref{f.perp-focus-tangent}, we focus on the segments $AN,NA'$ (Figure~\ref{f.segments-major}). We can deduce the angles that are shown.
\begin{itemize}
\item $CY\parallel S'P$ (Theorem~\ref{thm.perp-tangent}) so $\angle CYP = \angle S'PT'$ by corresponding angles.
\item $\angle S'PT' = \angle SPY$ by Theorem~\ref{thm.tangent-angles} since they are the angles to the foci at the tangent.
\item $\angle SYP$ and $\angle SNP$ are right angles and therefore $SYPN$ is quadrilateral that can be circumscribed by a circle whose diameter is $PS$.\footnote{It can be proven that a quadrilateral whose opposite angle are supplementary can be circumscribed by a circle. If two opposite angles are right angles that sum to $180^\circ$, then the other two angles must also sum to $180^\circ$.}
Therefore, $\angle SPY = \angle SNY$ since they are subtended by the same chord $YS$.
\end{itemize}
Since $\angle CYT\sim \angle CNY$ and $\angle 	YCT$ is a common angle,
$\triangle CYT\sim \triangle CNY$ and
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{CN}{CY}&=&\frac{CY}{CT}\nonumber\\[6pt]
CN\cdot CT&=&CY^2=AC^2\,,\label{eqn.cnctacac}
\end{eqnlabels}
since the perpendicular to the tangent from a focus is on the circumscribing circle (Theorem~\ref{thm.perp-tangent}). Since $NT=CT-CN$, we have $CN\cdot NT = CN\cdot CT - CN^2$ which equals $AC^2-CN^2$ by Equation~\ref{eqn.cnctacac}. This in turn equals $AN\cdot NA'$ by Theorem~\ref{thm.dividing}.\hqed

Construct the normal to the tangent at $P$ and let its intersection with the conjugate diameter $DK$ be $F$ and its intersection with the major axis be $G$. Construct a perpendicular from $P$ to the major axis and let its intersection be $N$. Let the intersection of the tangent with the minor axis be $T$ and its intersection with the major axis be $T'$ (Figure~\ref{f.parallelogram-conjugate-diameters}).
\begin{theorem}\label{thm.parallelogram1}
\[
PF\cdot PG = BC^2\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
$\triangle NPG \sim \triangle FPJ$ (rotate $\triangle NPG$ to see this) so $\angle PGN=\angle PJF = \alpha$ and
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{PF}{PN}&=&\frac{PJ}{PG}\nonumber\\[6pt]
PF\cdot PG &=& PJ\cdot PN\,.\label{eqn.pnpj}
\end{eqnlabels}%
By vertical angles $\angle PGN = \angle CGF = \alpha$ so 
$\triangle NPG\sim \triangle FCG$ and $\angle NPG = \angle FCG = \beta =90^\circ-\alpha$. By adding $\beta$ to the right angles $\angle BCN$ and $\angle TPF$, we get that $\angle TCJ = \angle TPJ$ and therefore $TPJC$ is a parallelogram, so $CT=PJ$ and $PF\cdot PG = CT\cdot PN$. By Equation~\ref{eqn.pnpj}, the theorem will be proven if we can show that $CT\cdot PN=BC^2$.

$\triangle TT'C\sim \triangle PT'N$ so 
\begin{eqn}
\frac{CT}{CT'}&=&\frac{PN}{NT'}\\[6pt]
\frac{CT}{PN}&=&\frac{CT'}{NT'}\,.
\end{eqn}

Multiplying each side by fractions equal to $1$ gives
\[
\frac{CT\cdot PN}{PN^2}=\frac{CT'\cdot CN}{CN \cdot NT'}\,.
\]
By Equation~\ref{eqn.cnctacac}, $CN\cdot CT' = AC^2$, and by Theorem~\ref{thm.cnntacac}, $CN\cdot NT'=AN\cdot NA'$, so
\[
\frac{CT\cdot PN}{PN^2}=\frac{AC^2}{AN\cdot NA'}\,.
\]
Multiplying by $PN^2/PN^2$ and using Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios-besant} gives
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{CT\cdot PN}{PN^2}&=&\frac{PN^2}{AN\cdot NA'}\cdot \frac{AC^2}{PN^2}=\frac{BC^2}{AC^2}\cdot \frac{AC^2}{PN^2}\nonumber\\[6pt]
CT\cdot PN&=&BC^2\,.\label{eqn.ctpn}\fqed

This theorem proves Theorem~\ref{thm.conj-diam-para} in Euclidean geometry.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.area-parallelogram}
The area of the parallelogram formed by the tangents at the ends of the conjugate diameters $PP',DK$ is equal to the area of the rectangle enclosing the ellipse at the ends of the axes (Figure~\ref{f.parallelogram2}).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the definition of conjugate diameters, it is sufficient to show that the area of $PCDL$ is $AC\cdot BC$. The area of a parallelogram is width times height so it is $CD\cdot PF$. 

By vertical angles $\angle DCM = \angle GCF$ and $\angle CGF = \angle PGN$, so $\triangle DCM\sim \triangle PGN$ 
\[
\frac{PG}{CD}=\frac{PN}{CM}\,,
\]
and by Theorem~\ref{thm.cmpnacbc}
\begin{eqnlabels}
\frac{PG}{CD}&=&\frac{AC}{BC}\nonumber\\[6pt]
\frac{CD}{AC}&=&\frac{PG}{BC}\,.\label{eqn.cdac}
\end{eqnlabels}
By Theorem~\ref{thm.parallelogram1},
\begin{equation}
\frac{PG}{BC}=\frac{BC}{PF}\,.\label{eqn.pgbc}
\end{equation}%
From Equations~\ref{eqn.cdac} and~\ref{eqn.pgbc} gives $CD\cdot PF = AC \cdot BC$.\hqed
