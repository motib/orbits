\section{Ellipses in Euclidean geometry}\label{s.geometry}

The proofs of theorems about planetary freely used analytic geometry and trigonometry, but for many years after the invention of analytic geometry, mathematicians continued to limit themselves to Euclidean geometry. Even into the late nineteenth century, students continued to study the original works of Euclid and Newton. In this section, I present proofs in Euclidean geometry (\emph{geometric proofs}) of theorems that appeared in the previous sections. 

The section starts with geometric proofs of several theorems on triangles that will be needed below. The next subsection defines ellipses in terms of the geometric concepts of focus and directrix instead of the familiar analytic definition, points which satisfy the following equation for $0<a,b$:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\,.
\]
This is followed by a theorem on focal chords and then a subsection on constructing a right angle at the focus of an allipse.

\subsection{Theorems on triangles}

\subsubsection*{The median of the hypotenuse}

\begin{theorem}
Let $ACB$ be a right triangle and let $D$ be the intersection of the median from $C$ and the hypotenuse $AC$ (Figure~\ref{f.median}). Then $CD=AB/2$ and
\[
AD \cdot DB = DC^2\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}[b]
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

\draw (0,0) coordinate (C) node[below left] {$C$} -- 
  (6,0) coordinate (B) node[right] {$B$} --
  (0,4) coordinate (A) node[above left] {$A$} -- cycle;
\draw (C) rectangle +(6pt,6pt);
\draw (C) -- ($(A)!.5!(B)$)
  coordinate (D) node[above,xshift=2pt] {$D$};
\path (A) -- node[above] {$a$} (D) --
  node[above] {$a$} (B);
\coordinate (E) at ($(C)!.5!(B)$);
\draw[thick,dashed] (D) -- (E) node[below] {$E$};
\draw (E) rectangle +(6pt,6pt);
\path (C) -- node[below] {$c_1$} (E) -- node[below] {$c_2$} (B);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{Median to the hypotenuse}\label{f.median}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
Drop the perpendicular from $D$ to $BC$ and label the intersection by $E$.

By similar triangles,
\begin{eqn}
\frac{a}{c_2} &=& \frac{a+a}{c_1+c_2}\\[6pt]
c_1&=&c_2\,.
\end{eqn}
Therefore, $\triangle DEC\cong \triangle DEB$ and $DC=DB$.\hqed
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Adjacent pairs of similar triangles}

I have not encountered the following definition before but it explicitly expresses a relation among similar triangles that would have been obvious to geometers.

\begin{definition}
An \emph{adjacent pair of similar triangles} is a pair of (a pair of) similar triangles that share sides (Figure~\ref{f.adjacent}). $\triangle BAC\sim \triangle EAF$ and $\triangle CAD\sim \triangle FAG$ are an adjacent pair of similar triangles.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For the adjacent pair of similar triangles in Figure~\ref{f.adjacent},
\[
\frac{AB}{AE}=\frac{AD}{AG}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} By similar triangles,
\begin{eqn}
\frac{AB}{AE}&=&\frac{AC}{AF}\\[6pt]
\frac{AC}{AF}&=&\frac{AD}{AG}\\[6pt]
\frac{AB}{AE}&=&\frac{AD}{AG}\,.
\end{eqn}\hqed
\end{proof}

Similar ratios hold between other sides of $\triangle BAC$ and $\triangle CAD$ by using an intermediate step with $AC$. We will use the term \emph{by an adjacent pair of similar triangles} and leave it to the reader to make the intermediate step.

\subsubsection*{The angle bisector theorems}

The angle bisector theorems are used extensively in the study of conic systems, often implicitly.
\begin{theorem}[Interior angle bisector theorem]
\label{thm.interior-angle-bisector}
In $\triangle ABC$ let $D$ be a point on $BC$ (Figure~\ref{f.interior-angle-bisector}). Then $AD$ bisects $\angle CAB$ \emph{if and only if}
\[
\frac {BD}{CD}=\frac {AB}{AC}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{The interior angle bisector theorem}
\label{f.interior-angle-bisector}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $AD$ bisects $\angle BAC$. Construct a line through $C$ parallel to $AB$ and let its intersection with $AD$ be $E$. By alternate interior angles, $\angle BAD=\angle CED=$ and by vertical angles $\angle BDA=\angle CDE$. Therefore, $\triangle ABD\sim \triangle EDC$ so
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AB}{CE}\,.
\]
$\triangle ECA$ is isoceles so $CE=AC$ and
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AB}{AC}\,.
\]
To prove the converse just ``run'' the proof backwards.
\hqed
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{theorem}[Exterior angle bisector theorem]
\label{thm.exterior-angle-bisector}
In $\triangle ABC$ let $D$ be a point on the extension of $CB$ outside the triangle (Figure~\ref{f.exterior-angle-bisector}). Then $AD$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle BAC$ if and only if
\[
\frac {BD}{CD}=\frac {AB}{AC}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $AD$ bisects $BAF$. Construct a line through $B$ parallel to $AD$ and let its intersection with $AC$ be $E$. By alternate interior angles $\angle BAD=\angle ABE$ and by corresponding angles $\angle FAD=\angle AEB$. Therefore, $\triangle BCE\sim \triangle DCA$ so
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AE}{AC}\,.
\]
But $\triangle BAE$ is isoceles so $AE=AB$ and
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AB}{AC}\,.
\]
To prove the converse just ``run'' the proof backwards.

\subsection{The definition of an ellipse using the focus and the directrix}

\begin{definition}
Let $d$ be a line (the \emph{directrix}) and $S$ be a point (the \emph{focus}) not on the directrix. Let $0<e<1$ be a number (the \emph{eccentricity}). An \emph{ellipse} is the geometric locus of points $P$ such that the ratio of  $PS$ to the distance of $P$ to the directrix is $e$.
\end{definition}

All the conic sections (parabolas, ellipses and hyperbolas) are defined the same way and are distinguished by their eccentricity. You might be familiar with the definition of the parabola where $e=1$ (Figure~\ref{f.parabola}).

Let $X$ be the intersection of the perpendicular to the directrix from $S$. $A$ on $SX$ is a \emph{vertex} of the ellipse if $SA/AX=e$ (in Figure~\ref{f.def-ellipse}, $e=1/2$).

\subsubsection*{Constructing the vertices}

\begin{eqn}
SA+AX&=&SX\\[4pt]
SA&=&SX\cdot \frac{e}{1+e}\\[4pt]
AX&=&SX\cdot \frac{1}{1+e}\,.
\end{eqn}
Similarly, there is a second vertex $A'$ where
\begin{eqn}
A'X-SA'&=&SX\\[4pt]
SA'&=&SX\cdot \frac{1}{1-e}\\[4pt]
A'X&=&SX\cdot \frac{2-e}{1-e}\,.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsubsection*{Constructing points on an ellipse}

Select an \emph{arbitrary} point $E$ on the directrix and construct lines from $E$ through $A$ and $S$. The line through $S$ will make an angle $\alpha$ with $SX$. Construct a line from $S$ at the \emph{same angle} $\alpha$ from $ES$ and let its intersection with $EA$ be $P$. Construct the perpendicular from $P$ to the directrix and let $K$ be its intersection with the directrix. Let $L$ be the intersection of $KP$ with $ES$ (Figure~\ref{f.construct}).

Let us continue with the construction of Figure~\ref{f.construct} as shown in Figure~\ref{f.focal-chord}. Construct the second vertex $A'$. Construct $EA'$ and label its intersection with $SP$ by $P'$. Construct a perpendicular from $P'$ to the directrix and label its intersection with the directrix by $K'$. Label the intersection of $P'K'$ and $EL$ by $L'$.
\begin{theorem}
The point $P'$ is on the ellipse and since $PP'$ intersects $S$ it is a focal chord.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\triangle SEA' \sim \triangle L'EP'$ and $\triangle XES\sim K'EL'$ are adjacent similar triangles, so
\[
\frac{P'L'}{P'K'}=\frac{SA'}{A'X}\;.
\]
By alternate interior angles and vertical angles we have $\angle SL'P'=\angle L'SP'$ so triangle $\triangle SL'P'$ is isoceles and $P'L'=SP'$. Therefore,
\[
\frac{SP'}{P'K'}=\frac{SA'}{A'X}=e\,,

and $P'$ is a point on the ellipse.\hqed

\subsection{A right angle at the focus of an ellipse}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.bisect}
Let $P,P'$ be points on the ellipse and let $F$ be the intersection of $PP'$ with the directrix. Then $FS$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle P'SP$(Figure~\ref{f.bisect-angle}).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Since $P,P'$ are on the ellipse 
\[
\frac{SP}{PK}=\frac{SP'}{P'K'}=e\,,
\]
and since $\triangle PFK\sim P'FK'$,
\[
\frac{SP}{SP'}=\frac{PK}{P'K'}=\frac{PF}{P'F}\,.
\]
By the exterior angle bisector theorem $FS$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle P'SP$.\hqed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.right-angle}
Let $P$ be a point on the ellipse and construct lines $PA,PA'$. Label their intersections with the directrix by $E$ and $F$, respectively. Then $\angle FSE$ is a right angle (Figure~\ref{f.bisect-angle}).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$P,A,A'$ are all points on the ellipse so Theorem~\ref{thm.bisect} applies. $FS$ bisects $\angle PSA=2\gamma$ and $ES$ bisects $\angle P'SA=2\delta$, so $2\gamma + 2\delta= 180^\circ$ and $\angle FSE=\gamma + \delta= 90^\circ$.\hqed
\end{proof}
