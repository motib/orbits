\subsection{Constructing a circle from three points}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.three-points}
Given three non-collinear points,\footnote{\emph{Collinear} means that the points all on the same line.} a circle can be constructed that goes through all three points.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Three non-collinear points $A,B,C$ define a triangle $\triangle ABC$ (Figure~\ref{f.kepler-circumscribed}). Construct the perpendicular bisectors of any two of its three sides, say, $AC$ and $BC$. By definition the perpendicular bisector is the geometric locus of points equidistant from the endpoints of the segment. Let $O$ be the intersection of the two bisectors. Then the $AO=CO=BO$ is the radius of a circle centered at $O$ that goes through $A,B,C$.\hqed
\end{proof}

\subsection{The altitude to a hypothenuse}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.dividing}
Let $AA'$ be a line segment whose midpoint is $C$. Then 
\[
AC^2-CN^2=AN\cdot NA'\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

%\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.2]

\draw (0,0) coordinate (A) node[below] {$A$} -- 
  (2.5,0) coordinate (N) node[below] {$N$} --
  (4,0) coordinate (C) node[below] {$C$} -- 
  (8,0) coordinate (AP) node[below] {$A'$};
\vertexsm{A};
\vertexsm{N};
\vertexsm{C};
\vertexsm{AP};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
%\caption{Dividing one-half of a line segment}\label{f.dividing}
%\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
$AN=AC-CN$ and $NA'=A'C+CN=AC+CN$ since $C$ is the midpoint of $AA'$. The result is obtaining by multiplying the two equations.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.alt-hypo}
Let $Q$ be a point on a circle whose diameter is $AA'$ and construct a perpendicular $QN$ to the diameter (Figure~\ref{f.circle-besant}). Then
\[
QN^2=AN\cdot NA'\,.
\]
The equation also holds if \emph{it is given} that $\triangle AQA'$ is a right triangle.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
An angle that subtends a diameter is a right angle. Since the sum of the angles of a triangle is $180^\circ$, we can label the angles as shown in the Figure, from which follows that $\triangle QNA \sim\triangle A'NQ$. Therefore,
\[
\frac{QN}{AN} = \frac{NA'}{QN}\,.\fqed
\]
\end{proof}

\subsection{The median of the hypotenuse}

\begin{theorem}
Let $ACB$ be a right triangle and let $D$ be the intersection of the median from $C$ and the hypotenuse $AC$ (Figure~\ref{f.median}). Then $CD=AB/2$ and
\[
AD \cdot DB = DC^2\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

\draw (E) rectangle +(8pt,8pt);

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\caption{Median to the hypotenuse}\label{f.median}
\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
Drop the perpendicular from $D$ to $BC$ and label the intersection by $E$.

By similar triangles,
\begin{eqn}
\frac{a}{c_2} &=& \frac{a+a}{c_1+c_2}\\[6pt]
c_1&=&c_2\,.
\end{eqn}
Therefore, $\triangle DEC\cong \triangle DEB$ and $DC=DB$.\hqed
\end{proof}

\subsection{Adjacent pairs of similar triangles}

I have not encountered the following definition before but it explicitly expresses a relation among similar triangles that would have been obvious to geometers.

\begin{definition}
An \emph{adjacent pair of similar triangles} is a pair of (a pair of) similar triangles that share sides (Figure~\ref{f.adjacent}). $\triangle BAC\sim \triangle EAF$ and $\triangle CAD\sim \triangle FAG$ are an adjacent pair of similar triangles.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
For the adjacent pair of similar triangles in Figure~\ref{f.adjacent},
\[
\frac{AB}{AE}=\frac{AD}{AG}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof} By similar triangles,
\begin{eqn}
\frac{AB}{AE}&=&\frac{AC}{AF}\\[6pt]
\frac{AC}{AF}&=&\frac{AD}{AG}\\[6pt]
\frac{AB}{AE}&=&\frac{AD}{AG}\,.\fqed
\end{eqn}
\end{proof}

Similar ratios hold between other sides of $\triangle BAC$ and $\triangle CAD$ by using an intermediate step with $AC$. We will use the term \emph{by an adjacent pair of similar triangles} and leave it to the reader to make the intermediate step.

\subsection{The angle bisector theorems}

The angle bisector theorems are used extensively in the study of conic systems, often implicitly.
\begin{theorem}[Interior angle bisector theorem]
\label{thm.interior-angle-bisector}
In $\triangle ABC$ let $D$ be a point on $BC$ (Figure~\ref{f.interior-angle-bisector}). Then $AD$ bisects $\angle CAB$ \emph{if and only if}
\[
\frac {BD}{CD}=\frac {AB}{AC}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

% Get their intersection and draw lines between vertices

\caption{The interior angle bisector theorem}
\label{f.interior-angle-bisector}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $AD$ bisects $\angle BAC$. Construct a line through $C$ parallel to $AB$ and let its intersection with $AD$ be $E$. By alternate interior angles, $\angle BAD=\angle CED=$ and by vertical angles $\angle BDA=\angle CDE$. Therefore, $\triangle ABD\sim \triangle EDC$ so
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AB}{CE}\,.
\]
$\triangle ECA$ is isoceles so $CE=AC$ and
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AB}{AC}\,.
\]
To prove the converse just ``run'' the proof backwards.\hqed
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Exterior angle bisector theorem]
\label{thm.exterior-angle-bisector}
In $\triangle ABC$ let $D$ be a point on the extension of $CB$ outside the triangle (Figure~\ref{f.exterior-angle-bisector}). Then $AD$ bisects the exterior angle of $\angle BAC$ if and only if
\[
\frac {BD}{CD}=\frac {AB}{AC}\,.
\]

\begin{proof}
Suppose that $AD$ bisects $BAF$. Construct a line through $B$ parallel to $AD$ and let its intersection with $AC$ be $E$. By alternate interior angles $\angle BAD=\angle ABE$ and by corresponding angles $\angle FAD=\angle AEB$. Therefore, $\triangle BCE\sim \triangle DCA$ so
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AE}{AC}\,.
\]
But $\triangle BAE$ is isoceles so $AE=AB$ and
\[
\frac{BD}{CD}=\frac{AB}{AC}\,.
\]
To prove the converse just ``run'' the proof backwards.\hqed
