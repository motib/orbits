\chapter{Constructing an ellipse}\label{s.constructing}

The simplest method for constructing an ellipse is the \emph{gardener's method} (Figure~\ref{f.gardener}): given $a$, the length of the semi-major axis and two points $S,H$, the foci, attach a rope of length $2a$ to two stakes at the foci and pull taut with a pencil. As the pencil moves around the foci maintaining tension on the rope, it will trace an ellipse.

This Chapter presents more accurate methods for drawing ellipses. First, we review two methods to construct \emph{individual points} on an ellipse (Section~\ref{s.individual}).  Section~\ref{s.roulette} describes a \emph{roulette} called the \emph{Tusi couple}. This is followed by four methods of constructing an ellipse with a \emph{glissette} (Section~\ref{s.glissette}): the \emph{Trammel of Archimedes}, two articulated glissettes by Frans van Schooten, and the triangle glissette. Section~\ref{s.perfect} presents the \emph{perfect compass} which can construct all conics and Section~\ref{s.confocal} describes how to construct an ellipse that is \emph{confocal} with a given ellipse.

\section{Constructing individual points on an ellipse}\label{s.individual}

\subsubsection*{From an arbitrary point on the directrix}

Let us repeat without proof the construction for Theorem~\ref{thm.point-on-an-ellipse} (Figure~\ref{f.construct1}, where $X,S,A$ have the same meaning as before). Given $a$, the length of the semi-major axis and $c$, the distance of a focus from the center, let $E$ be a point on the directrix and construct lines from $E$ through $A$ and $S$. The line through $S$ will make an angle $\alpha$ with $XS$. Construct a line from $S$ at the \emph{same angle} $\alpha$ from $ES$ and let its intersection with $EA$ be $P$. Then $P$ is a point on the ellipse.

\subsubsection*{From an arbitrary angle to the circumscribed and inscribed circles}

Recall the parametric representation of an ellipse (Definition~\ref{def.parametric}).Ggiven $a$ and $b$, the lengths of the semi-axes, onstruct two concentric circles, one of radius $a$ (dotted red) and one of radius $b$ (dashed blue) (Figure~\ref{f.parametric1}). For an arbitrary angle $t$, construct a ray that intersects the two circles at $P_O$ and $P_I$. Draw a perpendicular from $P_I$ to the $y$-axis and a perpendicular from $P_O$ to the $x$-axis. The intersection of the two perpendicular lines $P$ is a point on the ellipse.

\section{A roulette for drawing an ellipse}\label{s.roulette}

A \emph{roulette} is a curve generated by one curve $c_1$ \emph{rolling} on another curve $c_2$. An ellipse can be generated by a circle of radius $r$ rotating within the circumference of a circle of radius $2r$; this is called the \emph{Tusi couple}.

\begin{proof}
Let $C$ be the center of $c_1$ and let $O$ be the center of $c_2$. Let $E$ be an arbitrary point on $c_2$ where it is in contact with $c_1$. The radius $OE$ of length $2r$ is a chord of $c_1$ and since it equals twice the radius of $c_1$ it is a diameter and passes through $C$. $c_1$ will intersect $OA$ at some point $Q$ and since $OE$ is a diameter of $c_1$, $\angle EQO$ is a right angle.

$\angle ECQ=2\cdot\angle EOQ=2\alpha$ because $\angle ECQ$ is a central angle of $c_1$ subtended by $EQ$ which also subtends the inscribed angle $\angle EOQ$. Therefore the arc $\widehat{EQ}$ equals $2\alpha r$. But $\angle EOQ$ is the same angle as $EOA$ and is therefore an inscribed angle of $c_2$. It follows that the arc $\widehat{EA}$ equals $2r\alpha$ and $\widehat{EA} =\widehat{EQ}$, so as $c_1$ rotates, $Q$ is always on the diameter.

Let $P$ be an arbitrary point on $CQ$ and construct $RP\parallel EQ$ and $R'P\parallel OQ$. Let $N$ be the intersection of $RP$ with $OA$. Since $CE=CQ$ are radii of $c_1$, by $RP\parallel EQ$, $\triangle PCR\sim \triangle QCE$ so $\triangle PCR$ is isosceles and $CP=CR=a$. Similarly, $\triangle PCR'$ is isosceles and $CP=CR'=a$.

Now let $c_1$ rotate within $c_2$. Since $P$ is fixed relative to $C$, $OR=r+a$ and $OR'=r-a$ are constant and their loci are circles. From $R'P\parallel ON$ we get $\triangle RPR'\sim \triangle RNO$ and
\[
\frac{PN}{RN} = \frac{OR'}{OR}=\frac{PQ}{OR}\,,
\]
since $OR'=r-a=PQ$. By Theorem~\ref{thm.ellipse-b-over-a-besant}, the locus of $P$ is an ellipse with $OR$ the semi-major axis and $OR'=PQ$ the semi-minor axis.

Figure~\ref{f.roulette2} shows traces of $P,R,R'$.\hqed

\section{Glissettes for drawing an ellipse}\label{s.glissette}

\subsection*{The trammel of Archimedes}

 A \emph{glissette} is a curve generated by one curve $c_1$ \emph{sliding} on another curve $c_2$. In Figure~\ref{f.glissette1}, the line segment $AB$ is constrained to move such that $A$ slides on $OA$ and $B$ slides on $OB$ where $OA\perp OB$. Let: $P$ be an arbitrary point on $AB$, $C$ be the midpoint of $AB$, $PN$ the perpendicular to $OB$, and $Q$ intersection of $PN$ with $OC$. 

\begin{theorem}
As $A$ slides on $OA$ and $B$ on $OB$, the locus of $Q$ is a circle and the locus of $P$ is an ellipse.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
Since $OC$ is the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, $AC=CB=OC=x$  and therefore $\angle COA=\angle CAO$. $\triangle ACO\sim \triangle PCQ$ since $AO\parallel QP$, so $CP=CQ=y, OQ=AP=x+y$. Since $P$ is fixed on $AB$ even when $AB$ moves, $OQ$ is fixed (the length from $O$ to $Q$), so the locus of $Q$ is a circle centered at $O$.

Since $\triangle PCQ$ is isosceles, $\angle CPQ=\angle CQP=\alpha$ and $\angle CPQ=\angle BPN=\alpha$ by vertical angles. Therefore, $\triangle PBN\sim \triangle QON$ and
\[
\frac{PN}{QN}=\frac{PB}{OQ}=\frac{PB}{AP}\,.
\]
By Theorem~\ref{thm.ellipse-b-over-a-besant}, the locus of $P$ is an ellipse with $AP=x+y$ the semi-major axis and $BP=x-y$ the semi-minor axis.

Figure~\ref{f.glissette2} shows the loci of $P$ and $Q$ for $AB=10$.\hqed

\subsubsection*{First glissette}

Given $a,b$ let $ABD$ be an articulated arm of length $a+b$ with a rotating joint at its midpoint $B$. $D$ can slide on the $x$-axis $AK$ while $A$ can rotate at the origin (Figure~\ref{f.articulated1}). Let $E$ be at a fixed distance $b$ from $D$. Construct perpendiculars $EQ$ to $AL$ and $ER$ to $AD$.

\begin{theorem}
The locus of $E$ is an ellipse.

\begin{proof}
Using parametric equations, we have that 
\begin{eqn}
QE&=&\left[ \frac{a+b}{2}+\left(\frac{a+b}{2}-b\right)\right]\cdot \cos \alpha=a\cos \alpha\\

\subsubsection*{Second glissette}

Given $a,b$ let $ABE$ be an articulated arm of length $a+b$ with a rotating joint at $B$, where $AB=a, BE=b$. $D$, the intersection of $BE$ with the $x$-axis, can slide on the $x$-axis while $A$ can rotate at the origin (Figure~\ref{f.articulated2}). 

\begin{theorem}
The locus of $E$ is an ellipse.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$AB=AD=a$, $\angle BAD=\angle BDA=\alpha$ and $\angle NDE=\alpha$ by vertical angles. Therefore, the coordinates of $E=(x,y)$ are
\begin{eqn}
E &=& (-2a\cos \alpha - (b\!-\!a) \cos \alpha, (b\!-\!a)\sin \alpha)\\
&=& (-(a+b)\cos \alpha, b\sin\alpha)\,,
\end{eqn}
and a simple computation shows that 
\[
\frac{x^2}{(a+b)^2} + \frac{y^2}{(b-a)^2}=1\,,
\]
so $E$ is a point on an ellipse with semi-major axis $a+b$ and semi-minor axis $b-a$.\hqed

Figure~\ref{f.triangle2} shows that as $B$ slides down and $A$ slides right, $CQ$ rotates upwards while $OC$ rotates downwards. By considering the extremes ($A$ near $O$ and $B$ near $O$), we see that $OCQ$ will be ``concave'' up at one extreme and ``concave'' down at the other. Therefore, there must be a position of $AB$ which $OCQ$ is a line segment (green).

Referring now to Figure~\ref{f.triangle3}, let $OQ'$ (green) be this straight line segment and let $C,Q,P$ (red) be points generated by another arbitrary position of $AB$. Construct $CE\parallel OQ'$ which bisects $\angle PCQ$ since $CP=CQ$, and construct $PN\perp OQ'$ and $CL\perp OQ'$.

\section{The perfect compass}\label{s.perfect}

The \emph{perfect compass} is an instrument that is capable of constructing any conic section. It consists of an \emph{axis} attached to a point $A$ in the plane at an angle $\alpha$ to the plane. An \emph{arm} is attached at $B$ to the axis at an angle $\beta$ to the axis. The arm contains a pencil that can slide within the arm so that it is always in contact with the base. As the arm rotates around the axis it draws a conic section (Figures~\ref{f.perfect-image1}, ~\ref{f.perfect-image2}).\footnote{The images in the Figures are courtesy of the Associazione Macchine Matematiche. \\\hspace*{1.5em} \url{https://www.macchinematematiche.org/en/conics/compasso-perfetto.html}.\\\hspace*{1.5em} Animations of the perfect compass can be found at \url{https://www.geogebra.org/m/tMxr4Mah} and\\\hspace*{1.5em} \url{https://www.geogebra.org/m/uj2xauej}.}

The notation in the figures in the sequel conforms to the notation in \cite{henk}. $B$ denotes the point of attachment of the arm to the axis while $O$ is reserved for the center of the conic section. The axis is drawn in red and the arm in blue.

The parameters $\alpha, \beta, AB$ determine which conic section will be drawn. Here we limit ourselves to ellipses by specifying that $0< \beta <\alpha< 90$.

\subsubsection*{Constructing the major axis of an ellipse}

Consider an arbitrary point $A$ on an arbitrary line $l$ that (Figure~\ref{f.perfect-major}). Place the base of the axis at $A$ and rotate the axis until the arm at $B$ intersects the line $l$. There are two such intersections labeled $E$ and $D$. Let the midpoint of $ED$ be $O$. Construct the (outer) circle centered at $O$ with radius $OD=OE=r_o$.

The diagrams will be drawn in two dimensions: you have to imagine that $B$ is actually above the plane, and that the axis $AB$ and the arms $BD, BE$ have been ``laid flat.''

\subsubsection*{Constructing the minor axis of an ellipse}

Consider now the situation where axis is rotated to $-90^\circ$ and denote by $G$ the intersection of the arm with the plane. If you lay the compass flat, the axis $AB$ becomes $U$ (Figure~\ref{f.perfect-minor}). Extend $AG$ until it intersects the circle at $K$ and construct $OK=r_o$ (brown). Construct the perpendicular to $AK$ at $G$ and let its intersection with $OK$ be $L$. Draw the (inner) circle centered at $O$ with radius $OL=r_i$ (cyan). Construct the perpendicular to $ED$ at $O$ and let its intersections with the inner circle be $H,T$.

\begin{theorem}[Prop. VIII]\label{thm.propviii}
$\frac{AG}{AK}=\frac{HO}{OD}$, where $HO=r_i$ and $OD=r_o$ are the semi-minor and semi-major axes of an ellipse.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
By Theorem~\ref{thm.ratios-besant},
\[
\frac{AG^2}{DA\cdot AE} = \frac{HO^2}{OD^2}\,,
\]
and by Theorem~\ref{thm.alt-hypo}, $AK^2=DA\cdot AE$ .\hqed

Construct a line $LA'$ perpendicular to $OD$. Then $\triangle AKO \sim \triangle A'LO$, by Theorem~\ref{thm.propviii},
\[
\frac{A'L}{AK}=\frac{AG}{AK}=\frac{OL}{OK}=\frac{r_i}{r_o}=\frac{HO}{OD}\,,
\]
and $G$ is a point on an ellipse with semi-minor axis $r_i$ and semi-major axis $r_o$.\hqed
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof} (Proof 2)
$G$ will be on the ellipse if its coordinates satisfy the parametric representation (Definition~\ref{def.parametric}). Let $t$ be the angle between $OD$ and $OK$. $OA=r_o\cos t$ and $AG=r_i\sin t$ (Figure~\ref{f.perfect-parametric}), so $G$ is a point on the ellipse. \hqed
\end{proof}

\newpage

\begin{theorem}
The perfect compass constructs an ellipse.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Figure~\ref{f.perfect-ellipse} shows the ellipse (green) and you can check that $G$ is on the ellipse. It also shows that a symmetric construction gives the point $G'$ on the ellipse. Another symmetric construction shows that there are an additional pair of points to the left of the minor-axis.  We have now located six points on an ellipse. By Theorem~\ref{thm.five} we can conclude that the perfect compass constructs an ellipse.\hqed

\section{Confocal ellipses}\label{s.confocal}

We need the following theorem on the relationship between second-degree equations and conics. The familiar conics are parabolas, ellipses (circles) and hyperbolas, but straight lines are also conics, as are imaginary ellipses. To simplify the presentation, we focus on the familiar conics.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.five}
A second-degree equation describes a conic.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The general equation for a conic is
\[
ax^2+2bxy+cy^2+2dx+2ey+f=0\,.
\]
We omit the proof of one step: there is an equivalent equation that does not contain a term in $xy$.

First assume that the equation is second-degree, that is, that neither $a$ nor $c$ are zero. Then the equation can be written as
\begin{eqn}
a\left(x^2+2\frac{d}{a}x+\left(\frac{d}{a}\right)^2\right) - 
\frac{d^2}{a} + 
c\left(y^2+2\frac{e}{c}y+\left(\frac{e}{c}\right)^2\right) -
\frac{e^2}{c} + f&=&0\\
a\left(x+\frac{d}{a}\right)^2 + 
c\left(y+\frac{e}{c}\right)^2 &=& 
\frac{d^2}{a} +\frac{e^2}{c} -f \,.
\end{eqn}%
Denote the (constant) right-hand side of the equation by $k$. Perform a change of variables $u=x+(a/d),v=y+(e/c)$ and divide by $k$ to obtain
\[
\frac{u^2}{k/a} + \frac{v^2}{k/c}=k\,.
\]
The conic described by this equation depends on the values of $a,c,k$: 
\begin{itemize}
\item $k/a>0$ and $k/c>0$ is an ellipse.
\item  $k/a>0,k/c<0$ is a hyperbola. 
\item  $k/a<0,k/c>0$ is a hyperbola. 
\item $a=0$ but not $c=0$ and $d\ne 0$ is a parabola.
\item $c=0$ but not $a=0$ and $e\ne 0$ is a parabola.\hqed
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
Given five points, no four of which are collinear, there is a unique conic section containing the points (Figure~\ref{f.five-hyperbola}).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The equation for a conic is
\[
ax^2+2bxy+cy^2+2dx+2ey+f=0\,,
\]
but by dividing through by $a$ we obtain a monic second-order equation with only five coefficients. The problem is to show that there is a unique conic.

\caption{The conic passing through five points}\label{f.five-hyperbola}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Choose any four points. Since the four lines are not collinear, four lines can be drawn passing through each pair of points. In the Figure, the red line $x-y-1=0$ passes through $p_1, p_2$ and the red line $x+4y+1=0$ passes through $p_3,p_4$, so $(x-y-1)(x+4y+1)=0$. Similarly, the blue line $y=0$ passes through $p_2,p_4$ and the blue line $2x+y-5=0$ passes through $p_1,p_3$, so $y(2x+y-5)=0$. It follows that for arbitrary $k$, the second-degree equations
\[
(x-y-1)(x+4y+1) - ky(2x+y-5)=0\,,
\]
are the only equations passing through all four points. But a second-degree equation must describe a conic.

Substituting $p_5$ gives $4\cdot (-4) - k\cdot (-2)\cdot -1=0$, and $k=8$ is the \emph{only} value that satisfies that linear equation. We conclude that the conic
\[
(x-y-1)(x+4y+1) - 8y(2x+y-5)=x^2+19xy+4y^2-45y-1=0
\]
passes through all five points (green); in this case it is a hyperbola.\hqed
\end{proof}

\emph{Confocal ellipses} are ellipses with the same foci. Given an ellipse $E$, a confocal ellipse can be drawn using a modification of the gardener method. 

\begin{theorem}
Let $2a$ be length of the major axis of an ellipse $E$. Take a rope of length greater than $2a$, wrap it around $E$ and pull taut with a pencil. As you move around $E$, the pencil will trace a confocal ellipse (Figure~\ref{f.confocal1}).\footnote{The proof is from the solution for problem 46 in the 1890 edition of Besant \url{https://archive.org/details/solutionsexampl00besagoog}, with details supplied by ``Intelligenti pauca'' at \url{https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4908340/besants-proof-of-graves-theorem}.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}
To prove that the locus is an ellipse, let the tip of the pencil be at $T$ and very soon after let it be at $t$.The string forms two pairs of tangents $PT,TQ$ and $pt,tq$. Construct the perpendiculars $TV$ to $pt$ and $tv$ to $TQ$. $PT\approx pt$ so
\begin{eqnlabels}
PT&\approx&\widehat{Pp} +pV \approx \widehat{Pp} + pt-tV\nonumber\\
tV&\approx& \widehat{Pp} + pt - PT\,.\label{eqn.tv}
\end{eqnlabels}%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Since the length of the string is fixed, $PT+QT = pt+tq$ and $\widehat{Pp}\approx\widehat{Qq}$. Substituting into the Equation~\ref{eqn.tv} gives
\[
tV\approx \widehat{Qq} + QT - tq\,.
\]
By a similar approximation $Tv\approx \widehat{Qq} + QT - tq$ and therefore $tV=Tv$.

Consider now Figure~\ref{f.confocal-details} which is a detail from Firgure~\ref{f.confocal}. The angles $\alpha$ are vertical angles and we showed that $tV\approx Tv$ so $\triangle TVt\cong tvT$ and $\angle TtV=\angle tTv=\beta$.  What happens as $t$ approaches $T$? $tT$ becomes the ``left'' part of the tangent at $T$ and $Tt$ becomes the ``right'' part of the tangent.

Figure~\ref{f.confocal-angles} shows the resulting point $T$ and the equal angles $\beta$ which the tangent of the outer curve at $T$ makes with the tangents of the inner ellipse at $P,Q$. But by the isogonal property of ellipses (Theorem~\ref{thm.marden-tangent}), $\angle PTF_1=\angle QTF_2$. Therefore, the tangent at $T$ makes equal angles $\beta+ \gamma$ with the foci, so by Theorem~\ref{thm.tangent-angles} the outer curve must be an ellipses.\hqed
