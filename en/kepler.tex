\chapter{Elliptical orbits}\label{s.kepler}

Towards the end of the sixteenth century, the astronomer Tycho Brahe carried out extremely precise observations. In 1600 he hired Johannes Kepler as his assistant and when Tycho died soon afterwards, Kepler was appointed to his position. Here we explain how Kepler was able to establish that planetary orbits are ellipses.

\section{Determining the radius of the Earth's orbit}

A Martian year is $687$ days, that is, it equals $\frac{687}{365.25} = 1.88$ Earth years. We know when Mars reaches a ``new year'' by observing its projection on the celestial sphere, but each time the position of the Earth in its orbit will be different. Figure~\ref{f.kepler-mars} shows the orbit of the Earth---its center $O$ offset from the Sun $S$ as Copernicus showed---at four occasions when the position of Mars $M$ at its new year was observed. Four triangles are created $\triangle OE_iM$.

Tycho Brahe measured all three angles and the values of $OE_i$ given in the fourth column of the table are not equal. If the Earth' orbit is circular, he had to move the center of the orbit so that $\{E_1,E_2,E_3,E_4\}$ were all on the circle.

\section{Measuring the angles in the triangle Sun-Earth-Mars}


\begin{wrapfigure}[7]{R}{.5\textwidth}
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
\hline
& \multicolumn{1}{c}{\alpha} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\beta} &
  \multicolumn{1}{c}{\gamma} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{OE_i} \\\hline
E_1 & 127.1 & 20.8  & 32.1 & \;\; 0.6682\cdot OM\\
E_2 & 84.2 & 35.8 & 60.5 & \;\;0.6721\cdot OM\\
E_3 & 41.3 & 42.4 &96.4 & \;\;0.6785\cdot OM\\
E_4 & 1.6& 3.4& 175.0 & \;\;0.6805\cdot OM\\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
\end{wrapfigure}

How can the angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ be measured? $\triangle E_iOM$ is a triangle so it is sufficient to measure two of the angles. $\gamma$ is easily measured by observing Mars and the Sun at the same time, but neither $\alpha$ nor $\beta$ can be measured directly since they are not accessible to an observer on Earth.

Tycho's measurement used the known periods of the orbits to compute the angles. The Earth moves counterclockwise around Sun. Given any point $E$, for some $t$, $t$ days later the Earth will have moved to $E'$ and Mars will have moved to $M'$, so that they are in \emph{opposition}, that is, Mars will be on the continuation of the Earth-Sun line (Figure~\ref{f.kepler-opposition}). Since the Earth completes an orbit in about half the time that Mars takes to complete an orbit, $t$ will be such that neither the Earth nor Mars has completed a full orbit. The angles $\theta_E$ and $\theta_M$ are fractions of a circular orbit of $360^\circ$, so

\begin{eqn}
\frac{t}{365.25} &=& \frac{\theta_E}{360}\\[2pt]
\theta_E &=& \frac{360}{365.35}t\\[2pt]
\frac{t}{687} &=& \frac{\theta_M}{360}\\[2pt]
\theta_M &=& \frac{360}{687}t\,.
\end{eqn}

This gives values for $\theta_E$ and $\theta_M$. Since $E'M'$ is a straight line, we have that $\alpha-\theta_M = 180^\circ -\theta_E$, so that $\alpha = 180 - \theta_E + \theta_M$, and the values of $OE_i$ can be computed.

\section{A new location for the center of the Earth's orbit}

Kepler's next task was to obtain a new value $O'$ for the center of the Earth's orbit such that the $E_i$'s are on the orbit. Given the new locations of the Earth $\{E_1,E_2,E_3,E_4\}$, by Theorem~\ref{thm.three-points} a circle centered at $O'$ can be constructed that goes through $\{E_1,E_2,E_3\}$ (Figure~\ref{f.kepler-earth-new}). To verify that this is the correct orbit, check that $E_4$ is on the circle.

\section{Orbits are ellipses}

While Kepler was able to modify the center of the orbit of the Earth to be consistent with the observations, he was not able to adequately describe the orbit of Mars. After years of work, he came to the conclusion that the orbit must be oval like an egg. Oval, perhaps, but certainly not an ellipse, because ``the job would have been done by Archimedes \cite[p.~94]{hahn-cic}.'' Figure~\ref{f.kepler-egg} shows $C$, a position on a circular orbit, and an oval orbit (dashed), where $M$ is the position of Mars on the oval corresponding to $C$. The radius of the circular orbit is labeled $a=OA=OC$ and the unknown distances to $M$ are labeled $s=SM$ and $t=OM$.

Kepler's computed that $\frac{a-t}{t} = 0.00429$ and $\frac{s}{t} = 1.00429$, so that $(a-t)+t=s$
%\begin{eqn}
%\frac{a-t}{t} &=& \frac{s}{t}-1\\[4pt]
%a-t &=& s-t\,,
%\end{eqn}%%
and therefore $SM=s=a=AO$. The dashed oval is likely an ellipse, because in an ellipse $SM=AO$ (Theorem~\ref{thm.ellipses-features}). Kepler then computed the projections of the observations of Mars on the $x$-axis (Figure~\ref{f.kepler-ellipse}) and obtained for all of them that
\[
\frac{M_iO_i}{C_iO_i} = \frac{1}{1.00429}=0.99573\,.
\]
By Theorem~\ref{thm.ellipse-b-over-a}, $MO/CO=b/a$ is constant for an ellipse, and Kepler concluded that the orbit of Mars is an ellipse.
