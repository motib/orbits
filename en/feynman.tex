\chapter{Feynman's proof}\label{s.feynman}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Newton proved that if a planet is in an elliptical orbit around the Sun---as empirically determined by Kepler---it must be subject to the inverse-square law. Feynman proved the converse: if a planet is subject to the inverse-square law then its orbit is elliptical. 

\section{Dividing the orbit into sectors of equal angle}

Consider Kepler's second law as shown in Figure~\ref{f.f-equal-area}. If the planet traverses both the long arc $\widehat{P_1P_2}$ and the short arc $\widehat{P_3P_4}$ in the same period of time, its speed during $\widehat{P_1P_2}$ must be greater than the speed during $\widehat{P_3P_4}$. The speed will be greatest at the planets closest approach to the Sun at $p$ (the \emph{perihelion}) and least at $a$ (the \emph{aphelion}).\footnote{These terms refer only to orbits about the Sun; for an arbitary orbit, the terms are \emph{periapsis} and \emph{apoapsis}.}

Feynman's innovative approach was to divide the orbit not by sectors traversed in equal times, but into sectors of equal angles (Figure~\ref{f.f-equal-angles}). The planet will traverse $\widehat{P_1P_2}$ in a shorter time than $\widehat{P_3P_4}$ and the areas of the sectors will not be equal.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.f-proportional}
The area of a sector is proportional to the square of the distance of a planet from the Sun.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Figure~\ref{f.f-similar-triangles} shows two sectors with the same central angle $\alpha$ approximated by triangles $\triangle P_1SP_2$ and $\triangle P_3SP_4$. Since the central angles are the same, we can ``overlay'' $\triangle P_1SP_2$ on $\triangle P_3SP_4$ to form $\triangle P_1'SP_2'$ (red).

Draw a line $P_3'P_4'$ parallel to $P_1'P_2'$ such that $A_{\triangle P_3'SP_4'}$, the area of $\triangle P_3'SP_4'$, equals $A_{\triangle P_1'SP_2'}$ (blue). The dotted lines (green) show that by continuity such a line must exist. Since $P_1'P_2'\parallel P_3'P_4'$, $\triangle P_1'SP_2'\sim \triangle P_3'SP_4'$ and the sides of the triangles are proportional, $P_1'P_2'/P_3'P_4' = k$, as are the heights $h_{12}/h_{34}=k$. It follows that $A_{\triangle P_3'SP_4'}=k^2 A_{\triangle P_1'SP_2'}$. As the angle approaches zero, the triangles approach the sectors and the heights of the triangles approach the distance from the Sun to a position on the orbit.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.deltav}
For sectors whose angle is $\alpha$, the change in velocity $\Delta v$ is independent of $r$, the distance of the planet from the Sun!
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We have the following proportionalities.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{3em}}l}
$\Delta A \sim \Delta t$ &  Kepler's second law\\
$\Delta A \sim r^2$ &Theorem~\ref{thm.f-proportional}\\
$F \sim 1/r^2$& Inverse-square law\\
$F  \sim  \Delta v / \Delta t$& Newton's second law
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Together we get
\[
\Delta v \sim F \:\Delta t \sim F \:\Delta A \sim \frac{1}{r^2} \cdot r^2 = 1\,.\fqed
\]
\end{proof}

While Newton divided the orbit into sectors of equal time (Figure~\ref{f.grav-small}), Feynman divided the orbit into sectors of equal angle (Figure~\ref{f.f-orbit}). By separating the motion along the orbit into unaccelerated motion continuing from the previous sector, followed by accelerated motion towards the Sun with the same direction as at the start of the sector, the diagrams look similar. By theorem Theorem~\ref{thm.deltav}, changes in velocity are of equal magnitude.

\section{The velocity circle}

Let us forget about the orbit and extract just the velocity vectors (Figure~\ref{f.f-velocity}). The actual motion vectors such as $AB$ are the vector sum of the unaccelerated motion $AB'$ and the accelerated motion $B'B$. Since vectors only have a direction and magnitude, not a position, we can reposition the vectors to have a common origin (Figure~\ref{f.f-exterior-angles}). The next step is to prove that the exterior angles are equal, from which we can deduce that $\Delta v$ vectors (all of which are equal) form a regular polygon.

\begin{theorem}
The exterior angles of the velocity diagram are equal.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Figure~\ref{f.f-circle} is taken from the orbit diagram (Figure~\ref{f.f-orbit}) with the accelerated vectors extended. Let $X$ be he intersection of $CC'$ and $DD'$. By construction $CX\parallel BS$ and $DX\parallel CS$. By alternate interior angles, the angles at $C,D,X$  are equal (denoted $\alpha$). Since $\angle CXD=\alpha$, so is its vertical angle which is the exterior angle between $C'C$ and $D'D$ (examine Figure~\ref{f.f-exterior-angles}), and it follows that all exterior angles are equal.\fqed
\end{proof}

Consider the polygon whose sides are formed by the $\Delta v$ vectors for all sectors of the orbit. Since the exterior angles are equal, the polygon is regular, and as the number of sectors increases, the polygon approaches  the ``velocity circle.''

We can now work with a smooth orbit and the velocity circle as shown in  Figures~\ref{f.f-tangent}, \ref{f.f-vector-velocity}. In the velocity circle, the vector $v_a$ will be the longest line from origin of circle to its circumference (by Kepler's second law) and thus must pass through the center of the circle. The velocity vectors are tangents to the orbit, and as the planet moves in the orbit, they remain so. Since the orbit has been divided into sectors of equal angle, the sectors of the velocity circle are also equal, and therefore $\angle ASP = \angle aCp=\alpha$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The final step is to generate the elliptical orbit as the line $Cp$ rotates around the velocity circle. In Figure~\ref{f.f-elliptical-orbit} let $p$ be an arbitrary point on the velocity circle with origin $O$ and center $C$.\footnote{For convenience the circle is rotated $90^\circ$ clockwise relative to the circle in Figure~\ref{f.f-vector-velocity}.} Construct the perpendicular bisector of $Op$ at $M$ and let its intersection with $Cp$ be $P$.
\begin{theorem}
The locus of $P$ as $p$ moves around the velocity circle is an ellipse with foci $O,C$ and $OP+PC$ equals the radius of the circle.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
$\triangle POM\cong \triangle PpM$ by side-angle-side, so $OP=Pp=x$ and $CP+PO=CP+Pp=Cp$ which is the radius of the circle and therefore constant for any choice of $p$.\fqed
\end{proof} 

Feynman found this to be the most difficult step to discover \cite[p.~130]{lost} although the construction is similar to theorems on ellipses such as Theorem~\ref{thm.tangent-angles}.
