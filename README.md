Everyone ``knows'' that Kepler discovered that the orbits of the planets are ellipses and that Newton showed that an elliptical orbit implies that the force of gravity must be inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the Sun. Although I knew these facts, I had never seen them demonstrated. *Calculus in Context* by Alexander J. Hahn is a comprehensive textbook on introductory calculus that augments theory with  applications in physics and astronomy; these are not just historical anecdotes but detailed computations.

This document is a tutorial on the planetary orbits. Although Newton invented the calculus and used it to study motion, from the time of the Greeks, *proof* meant proof by Euclidean geometry. Newton's proof requires a depth of knowledge of Euclidean geometry and conic sections that is no longer studied today. The tutorial contains statements and proofs in Euclidean geometry of theorems on ellipses that were used by Newton and were still studied in the late nineteenth century, as can be seen in the comprehensive textbook published at that time by William H. Besant.
