Everyone ``knows'' that Kepler discovered that the orbits of the planets are ellipses and that Newton showed that an elliptical orbit implies that the force of gravity must be inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the Sun. Although I knew these facts, I had never seen them demonstrated.

*Calculus in Context* by Alexander J. Hahn is a comprehensive textbook on introductory calculus that augments theory with  applications in physics and astronomy, such as the work of Kepler, Newton and Galileo, as well as applications in engineering such as building bridges and domed structures. These are not just historical anecdotes but detailed computations.

This document works out one topic based on the presentation in the book and other sources: the determination of orbits by Aristarchus, Copernicus, Kepler and Newton.
